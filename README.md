# ucd-gradphys-lecture-notes-201920

If you're reading this, you've found my lecture notes for my first-year graduate physics coursework at the University of California, Davis for the academic year 2019-2020! They are based primarily on lectured material but may also draw on class handouts, example sheets, and other provided notes, as well as including hyperlinks to interesting non-course material. I will try to relegate to footnotes and clearly labeled subsections all non-lectured material for ease of studying later, but some hopefully fun tidbits may creep in.

## How to use these notes:
I have collected all the PDFs into a single folder for easy reference, so PDFs can be found at
pdfs/(course number)-notes-ucd.pdf

I will be naming the files by their official UC Davis course numbers and have included a key below for quick reference. PDFs also have a "Last updated" date in the header on the first page, so you can tell at a glance how recent the notes are.

## Disclaimer:
These lecture notes are prepared firstly for my own reference; I make no guarantees about their completeness or utility as a study guide for people who are not me. That said, I find it useful to unpack ideas which a lecturer may explain quickly or leave as an exercise, so I have included solutions to some exercises and worked through the details of calculations outlined in lecture. I try to rephrase mathematical ideas in plain language wherever possible, though I will try to make obvious when a bit of precision is sacrificed for clarity of expression. I also emphasize that these notes are intended as a supplement to the lecture content and are not a replacement for attending class.

These notes are still a work in progress! As such, their content is subject to change as I type some content in advance of class or update earlier lectures with reference to later ones and vice versa. If you dislike my writing style, please feel free to check out one of the other sets of lecture notes I have hyperlinked at the beginning of each PDF. I will not be uploading notes for the graduate classical mechanics course PHY 200A, as I previously completed an equivalent course elsewhere, and the 230B notes have also been discontinued, as the lecturer does not allow laptops in class. However, I will attempt to make the notes I do upload here as comprehensive and useful as possible.

If you would like to make use of the raw TeX files, please let me know at itlim@ucdavis.edu. This LaTeX template (with modifications) is originally courtesy of Arun Debray, who can be reached (as of the time of writing) at https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/a.debray/.

(n.b. if you're getting deja vu from this README, it's because I adapted the text from my Cambridge Part III notes. Check those out here: https://github.com/qmch/partiii-lecture-notes-201819)
