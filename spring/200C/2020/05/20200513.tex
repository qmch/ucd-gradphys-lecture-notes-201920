Four-vectors are pretty useful. We have contravariant vectors (index up) and covariant vectors (index down), and they transform differently under coordinate transformations.

Metrics $g_{\mu\nu}$ (and the inverse metric $g^{\mu\nu}$) tell us how to raise and lower indices. Equivalently they give us an inner product on the space, such that
\begin{equation}
    ds^2 = g_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu
\end{equation}
